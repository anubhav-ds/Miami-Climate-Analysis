# Miami-Climate-Analysis

In this project we will be analyzing the climate data of the city of Miami and its outskirts for the year 2023. Miami has been known across the world as a glamourous coastline city however with recent climate impacts it has become one of the most known example of cities where we can observe impact of climate change every year.

While we would have loved to make a detailed analysis coverign Oceanic data like Tides and ENSO for this project we will cover the only few selected parameters such as Precipitation, Temperature, Wind Speed, and Groundwater levels. Miami itself is not a big city so we also did our analysis on the districts near it, namely Kendall and Opa Locka. 

We used NOAA's Climate Data Online Portal to obtain weather related data for all three locations. For this we selected Airports based Stations as they had complete data for the period under consideration.

For groundwater levels we used NWIS data for the same period. We selected the well sites which are close to the airports, for simplicity sake, for this project we will name them as per the airports too.
